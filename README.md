12/24/2014 - This repo will most likely no longer be updated. The project was very interesting--I've learned quite a bit about logistic regression, stepwise model fitting, etc; but I believe that my approach to the question at hand may have been flawed, mostly due to inexperience with regression techniques at the time of attempt. I will return to this model question (and the fun data!) when I'm a bit more well-rounded. But, hey, I made some pretty ggplot2 graphics!
